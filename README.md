# dotfiles

Personal configuartion files for machines.

Currently just assumes a pure ubuntu box.

TODOS

[ ] Update the setup script so it works on macOS. Started by checking for brew but should ideally install brew (also other install cmds dont work)

[ ] Determine which shell is being used and update profilerc based on that

[ ] Install gh cli regardless of whether mamba is installed

[ ] Right now, python dev packages are just installed with whatever pip bash returns. Should be a real installer
